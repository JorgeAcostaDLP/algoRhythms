Team high five

Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
Lunch time is 1:00 to 2:30 
At 2:30pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master
Any conflicts are discussed and solved, people will explain results for the day, plans for working at home. 
If anyone needs to leave early bring it up on the morning meeting.
Team expectations


Fridays we will assign tasks for the weekend, and any need for pair programming or work from home.
Communication over the weekend will take place via message, everyone is expected to be available to provide helpful responses.
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally), everyone works in front end, back end
Majority rules
Group consensus on changes
Coding style, frameworks, variable names and technologies to use
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Say it
